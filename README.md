# ES6 Drills

* get use to work with template literals. use backmarks(`) to enclose areound the string. input variables by using the ${} function.

* define functions while using the arrow notation ex. let *functionName* = () => {};
* practice shorthand. single parameter functions do not need parenthesis. If return is the only thing being done then it can be placed on the right side of the arrow without curly brackets and the return call.
* Return object properties in a function and call them in a seperate function.
* ex. let *functionName* = () => {
    return {
        obj1: *val1*,
        obj2: *val2*
    }
};

* using the spread syntax split up an array to fill the needed properties of a function.
* usinge the spread syntax turn your name into a string. console log those results using a for loop.
